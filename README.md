# React Todo App with API
This is a simple Todo application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete  tasks. The app communicates with an external API to store and retrieve todos, making it suitable for use in real-world applications.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Fetch**: For making HTTP requests to the API.
- **Bulma**: For styling and layout.
- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
